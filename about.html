                <h2><strong>Testimonial</strong></h2>
                    <h3>"I don't think I ever thanked u for a valuable lesson of love many 
                        years ago on one of our TGI Friday nights, there was a homeless 
                        man sitting at a table and the staff was trying to get him to leave, 
                        you grabbed a menu and privately told the server to tell him to pick 
                        what he wanted to eat and to add it to your bill. No one else in our 
                        party knew what you did and the homeless guy never knew either, but 
                        I did! That made such an impression on me that I will never ever 
                        forget. You taught me about the dignity of each human life through 
                        your actions. You never questioned whether that man deserved it, 
                        and you were not even worried if he bought the most expensive thing 
                        on the menu, you just saw a need and filled it, with love and compassion. 
                        If there was ever a time I saw Jesus in earth, it was that night at dinner, 
                        through YOU! I am forever grateful for that lesson, and I remember thanking 
                        God for bringing you into my life that night. Thank you for being you."
